I don't know where I came from. I don't know where I start or end. My existence just began. 
I felt myself escaping, breaking through a shell.I started growing downwards, at least I thought as much. The heaviness got lighter and I began to feel warmth.
There was air and I felt something slide past me. I bean to feel stronger and I could feel myself stretching towards something, but I didn't know what.
I don't know how much time passed, but I began to feel hopeful. I don't know how, but I knew that I had a purpose. 
I felt something. It was so light I thought I missed it. I felt myself unfurling, all the weight I had known was gone. 
I looked up and it was dark. I searched all around, searching for my calling. Some time passed but I still couldn't find it. 
Suddenly I felt it, there in the distance. I felt the warmth. I turned towards the east and I knew I had found my God. 
She was so bright, so warm, so full of life. 
I don't know where I am. I don't know what I am. 
But I stare up, day after day, and I'm content.
This is who I am--my purpose is to just be. 
So, I'll continue to stare up at my God until time stops. 

I don't know whats happening. I hear a lound buzz. There's a smell to the air that's never been there before. 
Its getting closer and I feel the ground shaking. I'm spinning around. 
I feel detached but still I feel the warmth of God. 
Times passing and I'm starting to feel light. I no longer wish to feel the heat of God.
